1. Dictionary

A dictionary is a built-in data structure that stores key-value pairs.

student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A"
}

- Keys are unique and immutable 
- Values are non unique, mutable and can be of any data type

2. Key Properties 

- Dictionaries are mutable i.e you can add, delete amd update the values in a dictionary
- The keys in a dictionary must be unique 
- The dictionary usues hashing mechanism to lookup keys in O(1) complexity
- The items in dictionary are indexed by keys and not with positions like list or array
